		Learning to Fly!	
		</title>
		<description>
		Here you'll learn the basics of getting 
		a pilot certificate and read personal 
		accounts of people who have done it.  
		We think you'll find it interesting 
		and enjoyable reading, and we hope it 
		will help convince you to take a drive 
		to your local airport and sign up for 
		a first flight.
