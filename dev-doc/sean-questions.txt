Exception vs Throwable

Similar attempts:
ETL
Microsoft
compared to that web browser thingy, Grease Monkey

repeated errrors

work unit vs system logging
	what about when no work unit

error logs, show stack traces

setup errors

named field operations: singular vs multiple by default

severity of "none found"
	example: remove this field, not found
	example: match on this field

caching strategy
	config errors vs runtime errors

policy on known bad work units that have no error queue
	fall through
	or keep processing
	on the one hand, they are bogus, and may do damage if subseqeuent
		steps don't skip them
	on the other hand, a very small error may circumvent a lot of
		processing, and take time to debug

sever runtime errors
	perhaps internal incosistencies / coding errors
	key file is missing
	disk space, lack of permissions, unreachable site
		examples: csv vs http retrieve, vs http retriever cache
	pop culter: don't show errors that the user has no ability to fix
	different class
	immediate fatal?

I think I know: exit vs exception strategy

Replicate if no error queue
	pass to queue with error
	or drop

Language: xml vs more conventional vs special

UI?

sub xpumps, and using them to construct

reprioritizing
	forward vs back vs both
	creating new copies
	loops

global settings

default field naming

flexibility of parameter names, tag names
