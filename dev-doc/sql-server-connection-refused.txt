To check the enabled protocols for a server, follow these steps:
   1. In SQL Server 2000, start the SQL Server Network Utility
	svrnetcn.exe
   2. On the General tab, select the instance of Microsoft SQL Server on which to load an installed server network library.
   3. Make sure that TCP/IP appears in the Enabled Protocols list.
   4. To find the port number, in the Enabled Protocols list, click TCP/IP, and then click Properties. The Properties dialog box displays the port number. 
There is an known bug: SQL Server May Not Listen on TCP/IP Sockets When TCP/IP is the Only Protocol
