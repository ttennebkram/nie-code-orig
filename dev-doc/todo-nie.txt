Raritan MySQL bug
They were running 4.1, we should spec 5.1
??? Version of MySQL ?  Looks like we want 5.1
BLOB/TEXT column 'colname' used in key specification without a key length
Examples:
	nie_log normalized_query
	nie_log advertisement_code_sent
	nie_log_meta_data field_value
	nie_log_meta_data field_name

1.       Cosmetic bug: When you start configurator with none-existent  configuration file, it prompts whether it should create a file by that name. The dialog offers Yes, No, and Cancel. Yes and No work as expected, but Cancel gives a Java error in the command window from which configurator started.Cancel and No should work the same and exit w/o error.

2.       Question in configurator: If I'm using an API to do the heavy lifting, many of the fields are not required. Sometimes I've seen it give errors if parts are blank; I need to check to see whether any of the fields handled by API logic cause the Validate to give an error. In an ideal world, I'd say have an option that lets me select API or proxy, but as long as it doesn't cause validation errors that's ok.

Allow log directory, and give implicit file.
	Thought I did that, but didn't work.
	Check for dir.
	Check if no slash nor dot.
	Old task, thought done:
		? assign "niesrv.out" to logs/ dir if it points
			to a directory, not a file.
		in nie.core.RunLogBasicImpl.setOutputURI()

Configurator: no "test this search" button

LicGen, offer to update file?

hello_db/DBConfig should allow for -import_directory . to be optional

Configurator: too big for small screens, allow for scroll
Configurator: repaint issues on buttons

Add support for importing dates vi CSV, and maybe in some resonable formats


This is a known limitation if no terms have been mapped.
Fix: Define a map, then exit and restart.

Fri Aug  6: Ship (or before)
Fri Jul 30: FCS candidate
Fri Jul 23: 1st release candidate
Fri Jul 16: Final feature code freeze
Fri Jul  2: pri-A feature code freeze (goal)
Fri Jun 11: Aug release feature set / priorities


-----------------------------------------------------------------
June:

General plan:
* 7-8 week release cycles
* Each release will have ONE A-priority enhancement
	and then a list of B and C wish-list items
* Releases will have TWO feature-code-freeze dates
	- Freeze for A-priority item
	- later, if time permits, a freeze for B and C items
* Testing on A item will happen once initial code freeze happens
* Any issues with A priority will supercede B and C items
* Once A priority item is nailed down a code snapshop will be taken
	- an early release may be considered at that point
* Milestone dates typically on Fridays, allows for weekend work if needed

	Xilinx, Applera? (old PE, Mike B)

#End User Experience / Search Tuning Features
#############################################################
Miles: merge results from multiple places
	Ex: Db lookup of empoyee number and regular search
Miles: spelling check
Miles: partial matching, query contains, in order of words, wildcards
	how % buy % fridge
	how % buy % printer
	where % buy % printer
Miles: fut: help user to build extended query interactivly
	Example "skies", ask for size
M* C Miles: I *really* miss search-term specific images
M* behavior based on which form -> isn't this just multiple sites???
	what would UI look like?
	what reports would need to be changed/added?
better error screen
partial matches (match one word of a phrase, etc)
match on null search
match on no hits
match for EVERY query do this
long term: dymanic stream markup with chunking (to seem faster)


#Reporting Features
#############################################################
* Embed-able / guest reports
better icons
B Reports
	"orange": no results + not mapped + too many
	hyperlinked trend
	apply filter to report: ex: searches that had TFR, or by older dates
Miles: "don't bug me about this term any more" icon
category based (all cars reported under "auto", etc.)
document click through tracking / reporting
tracking sessions / specific users
D Miles: raw transactions should show IP address
D generally make showing nulls an option
D bug: For the past 7 day(s) - can't we make that days and
	day report 'day'? get rid of the s? We know what report it is?
? bug: search per day report should have drill dowm on num searches?
? enh: for repeated IP on raw trans, can we consolidate the COUTN for each
	and when u drill the term see the number?
	maybe add link to visitors details
Reports on Admin activity and Report viewing


#Administration (not including reporting)
#############################################################
* Real logins / roles
different users and passwords, different reports menus
S$ * Multiple sites, sub-sites, forms
	(need well defined UI, REPORTS, match rules, etc)
Emailing reports
	admin: errors, drop in search activity, etc.
	notices: orange report, new top term, new top visitor?
	regular: send me my favorite reports
	good titles/subject lines
	to NIE: admin, maybe others
B separate admin port
export CSV log data via UI
no cleartext password
auto fetch titles and summaries / actual validation
Add/update more thorough listing to XSLT admin show all config page

? B trend: 1st two terms i enterered are both there.. must have come 
	before any reports run. Now I doi a new search, notrhing shows up.

	to force a refresh every time?
? Prefixes can be combined.
? ! question marks in XSLT formatted dump?
?. Style tags for wm suggest and alt suggest
? express link/code

/ error level reporting option in server
/ allow option of "no icon"
/ refresh yourself command

	early java script work with new relative path
/ doc notice about console window highlights
/ doc notice about how to run report
	http://north:9000/?nie_sn_context=admin&cmd=showall
/ A trend: verify caching logic
/ A trend: don't show nulls by default
/ A trend: zero records, say "no data available"
/ A trend: min N rows, fill with -'s
/ A trend: respect max rows
/ C trend: more care in day vs days

x B bug: when u click on trend for diff period you get trend in middle of
	a screen.. htink I'd liek it on the SAME main screen but with diff
	selections?
/ C bug: font issues in reports
	he likes Most Pop Searches, all fields
		search term: nie_even_row nie_data_cell nie_report_link
			font-family:sans-serif
		count: nie_even_row nie_numeric_cell
		percent: nie_even_row nie_percentage_cell
			numeric and percent currently: font-family:sans-serif
				WAS MONOspaced way back
		Conclusion: Miles likes sans-serif
	differences on Search Details drill down
		2 font groups:
		Group 1: pages found, mapped, visitor address
			visitor address: nie_data_cell nie_report_link
				report_link is font-family:sans-serif
			found, mapped: nie_numeric_cell
				numeric is font-family:sans-serif;
		Prefers group 2: search terms, domain name, date and time
			search term: nie_data_cell
				data_cell is browser default (serif)
			domain name: nie_data_cell
			date and time: nie_datetime
				datetime is font-family: monospace; font-size:-1;
		Conclusion: Miles likes serif fonts, or mono-spaced smaller fonts,
			over sans-serif???
	review of report formatting, CSS consistency, etc.
	Fonts should be same
	most pop search report. look at font for terms
	drill down on term (miles/st)
	terms are in different font (looks better.. fix first page)
		(also font on IP addr & pages found/map looks diff 
		than font on term and domain and date/time
	drill down on visitor IP - back to original font for 'Search' 
		trans type
	font issue on searches per day
	I like the font on the Search Detail
	raw transaction: (also same font issues as above)
x C bug: raw trans report shows Adv Code and Adv URL
	/ A . converting data (new hooks in place, so in progess)
	/ A multiple URLs (support at all, allow edit)
	/ A testing with Oracle 8i (this *could* unleash some bugs)

	/ B trend report caching to disk and memory
	/ B indicating the default choice in drop downs
	/ terms in multiple maps (allow edit)
	/ fetch aopa ads from DB
	/ different look and feel per map (support at all, allow edit)
	/ format of advertisements in database?, xslt, etc. (left in xslt)
	/ A most freq visitor, click on ip for details, in Postgres
	/ B click through on null search brings back all queries
	/ A (new) double check map to url associations for urls that are no longer associated
	/ A test drive link, still showing nie stuff, no extra parms
	/ B postgres: many reports still broken
	/ A (new) "show results" test-drive feature broken
	/ B less severe error if no urls for map when editing
	/ B change hard failure to warning if editing map with no url
	/ B drop Ad related reports from main reports menu if not using Ads/markup
	/ C wms, border=1, no color, gives border around all of them
	x C db_init, first time run, gave errors, then no errors (can't repro)
	? D document suffix workaround for wms
	/ D document test drive search engine URL
	/ Oracle "max cursors" error  (woopie!!!!!)
	/ IE zero byte socket errors
	/ mangled HTML in blank forms
	/ mangled Webmaster Suggests box on NIE site
/ D remove * indicates required field if no required fields on form
/ search by url in map selector
/ C wrong reports if UI not enabled
/ C wrong menu items if UI not enabled
/ Edit should be Edit >> in report
/ D AOPA: respect blank lines in ads for aopa

/ D show maps, bold URL titles
/ More testing on editing and commits, make sure the data structures are still consistent
/ Bug: some spurious errors in output log
/ Bug: some inconsistencies when using the "find maps" form and report
/ Bug: "create new map" from "map lookup form" runs a report query
	instead of bringing up a new record, or is it redirecting?
/ Bug: should cleanup wildcard character in create link
/ Bug: inconsistency on subtitle on find map form
/ Item: replace use of % with * in code and in online doc, per Sean

	D help links
/ A bug: slow refresh

/ error level reporting option in server
/ allow option of "no icon"

Post 2.2 stuff:
/ add http:// to new URL field
/ fix return URL if I specifically go to the manage maps report
/ simple validation of URL (does it at least look like a URL)
/ no support for just alt terms
/ don't convert redir to wms if editing a URL, and don't req title
/ don't show "* indicates required field" if none shown


/ date-time stamop activity in server
/ settable Alt messages and colors
	except for doc listings, links
/ xml inherited fields
/ ? warn about duplicate entries (i think this is in place)
/ ? Is there a bug where you get a redirect after getting results?
	I think this was an artifact of the POST bug, I believe fixed now
/ command line arg for config file
/ time stamp in connection

/ Google responds to our fetch with a redirect
	the only difference I can see is that we (Java?) send a cookie:
	Cookie: PREF=ID=1afa84df4748eeeb:FF=4:TB=1:TM=1001056767:LM=1017939562:S=_U0psSvk4pM
