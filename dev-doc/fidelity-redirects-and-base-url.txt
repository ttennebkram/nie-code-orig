MANY problems with Fidelity

Confusing but OK
------------------
Using Frames
Deeply nested tables

Broken SearchTrack item # 1
---------------------------
Some queries redirect to a second search engine AND there are relative
paths to images and CSS that our BASE tag still points to orig.

FIX was to add <base_url> as sibling option to <search_url>

Broken SearchTrack item # 2
---------------------------
When a MULTI-WORD query is redirected, the 302 location header leaves
spaces UN-encoded, and this seems to break Java, although not browsers.

Fidelity and inquira continue to uncover weird / interesting problems.

I *think* I've found a Java bug, although I'll have to dig further, but I know the COMBINATION of TWO things that causes a PROBLEM for SearchTrack.

Queries that meet BOTH of these criteria will appear to "hang":
1: The query has spaces
AND
2: It happens to do a redirect to http://personal.fidelity.com (although this is hard to see if using frames)

SOME Fidelity queries are redirected to a second server, THEY control that, we don't.

Here are some examples:

OK, a single word
http://search.fidelity.com/search/getSearchResults?question=cancer

OK, two words, but RESULTS are still on search.fidelity.com
http://search.fidelity.com/search/getSearchResults?question=fidelity+investing

Break # 1, NOW FIXED
OK, REDIRECTS to personal.fidelity.com, LOOK AT ADDRESS BAR when viewing results list
http://search.fidelity.com/search/getSearchResults?question=401k

Break # 2, still broken 7/1/08
This one BREAKS because: multi word AND redirects to personal.fidelity.com
http://search.fidelity.com/search/getSearchResults?question=retirement+planning
Problem is caused by redirect where the location: http header field doesn't have the space escaped.
Same problem whether I replace the space with a plus sign (+) or hex encoded percent twenty (%20)
