		part of Spyder and UI utils
	a Best Bets link they told us about
	their base URL that they told us about

AuxIOInfo and NIEUtil
SearchLogger
	DB field names AND CGI
DBTableDef? potential mapping of CGI fields to DB
LoggingLink
	setContext
	setTransationType
	generateURL

DECODING Decoding (many places)

Decoding from CGI request to CGI fields
Decoding from HTML source to regular CGI URL
	THEN decoding that further
Multilevel CGI decoding?

SnRequestHandler.readCompleteRequest
calls NIEUtil.readHTTPRequestFromSocket
eventually NIEUtil.cgiDecodeVarsBuffer
	buffer comes from EITHER CGI GET ?xxx or POSTED data
	StringTokenizer on "&"
	look for '=', if non we assume "1"
