Lines are either:
1: Header line: declares IP address(es)
2: Term line and counts
3: # Comment Line
4: blank line, and RESETS header


A "batch" is a header line, followed by a set of term lines.


Header Line
-----------
Set an IP address(es) and name(s) that this batch of queries will come from.

An IP address has a number-version (1.1.1.1) and a name client5.foobar.com
* First column controls the NAME and "randomize mode"
* Second column controls the numerical IP address


First column has 3 forms:

NO! Single Fixed Address
NO! myname.foobar.com
NO! 	All searches in this section will be from that client

A single random name and address for ALL searches from this batch
*.foobar.com
	Make up a SINGLE IP address and Name for ALL searches
	in this section

A different random name and address for every search in this batch
+.foobar.com
	Make up a bunch of IP addresses
	a DIFFERENT one for each search


Second Column

(technicall optional)
set the base IP address
	The LEFTMOST number in a v4 IP address
	A number from 1 to 254

If you leave it blank, we make one up.  But might not be consistent
with other times you use the same name.


Examples

*.acme.com	100
Pretend that Acme owns all addresses from 100.0.0.0 to 100.255.255.255
And pick a radom address like 100.1.2.3 for each BATCH

+.acme.com	100
Pretend that Acme owns all addresses from 100.0.0.0 to 100.255.255.255
And pick a radom address like 100.1.2.3 for EVERY LOGGED search

*.acme.com	(no number, not recommended)
Pick a number from 1 to 254 for Acme, for example 17.
Then pretend that Acme owns all addresses from 17.0.0.0 to 17.255.255.255

*.acme.com	(second time, no number)
Pick ANOTHER number from 1 to 254 for Acme, for example 44.
Then pretend that Acme owns all addresses from 44.0.0.0 to 44.255.255.255

NOW some Acme queries will start with 17 and some will start with 44.
This might be noticed and considered odd.

Term Line
---------

First column: MUST BE BLANK.
Second column: term (required)
Third column: number of searches
	? If left blank... can make up # of times ...
Fouth column: number of matches (optional, I can backfill from Google)
	Can put 0 sometimes, for no matches.
Fifth column: total documents searched (rarely used)
	Only Verity K2 gave this info.

Blank Line
----------
Random ENDS with a blank line
Clears IP and IP prefix and name suffix

Comment Line
------------
Starts with # (pound sign)
Unlike a blank like, comment line does NOT reset the batch.
So you can comment out entries in a batch without breaking it in half.

Blank lines BREAK batches, comment lines do not.
