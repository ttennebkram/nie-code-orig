Subject: Kevin, one important note on the Build directory

Importance: High

Kevin,

Most of the NIE projects have src/nie/... and classes/nie/...

Since classes normally contain compiled code, one might expect that this
entire directory is "expendable", since the source code can just be re-made.

This is often NOT TRUE with our projects.

For both XPump/DPump and SearchNames, I needed a "system" directory to store
ancillary supporting files; files that are part of our install, but not an
actual .class

Java does have support for this idea.

However, these files are relative to the CLASSES, not the source code.

So in some of our classes trees you will see NON-.class files.

This may seem odd at build time; I was tempted to not even do it.

However, this works out VERY NICE at packaging/shipping time.  Our non
.class files live INSIDE the our JAR file, and are still accessible as
"files" inside Java.  It's a neat feature.

Examples:

I have an XML file that maps XPump in to DPump.  This becomes part of our
jar file.

I have XSLT files that format XML monitor data into HTML.  Again, these need
to be shipped with our product.  And by doing it this way, the get to ride
inside the jar file.

Just pointing this out, as it's perhaps non-obvious.

Mark
