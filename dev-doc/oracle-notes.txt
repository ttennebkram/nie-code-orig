Oracle client like sqlplus to remote server:

Can't just connect with sqlplus.  You used to be able to specify a long
commnad line string, including T: and a server name, this stopped working
as of Oracle 8 I think.

Now, run:
Note: The file this creates may require tweaking when you're done.
Programs / Oracle - OraHome92 / Configuration and Migration Tools
	/ Net Configuration Assistant
Define 2 things:
1: a process to listen locally (do I need this?)
	(*) Listener configuration
	Add one, and just accept defaults
2: define the alias that resolves to the remote resource
	(*, 3rd radio button) Local Net Service Name configuration
	add -> oracle 8i or later
	-> service name (I think what it is on the remote machine)
	-> tcp -> server name/ip address
	-> final name (? exact phrase) (I think how you'll refer to it here)
	Then it will ask to test, but it will fail, probably because
	the login is different, so tell it to change the login, enter
	new info, then try again.
OR
	Is it the 3rd radio button, Local Net Service Name configuration
	then radio Add
	Oracle 8i or later
	??? Service Name: like ender_stack (server_dbname)
	^^^ No, just "stack"
	then tcp
	host name: titan
	port: use default
	Yes, perform a test
	????
	titanstack

OK, let's suppose this doesn't work.

If it's a login issue, change your login.

Or if something about not resolving something like SYSTEM or maybe SOURCE

Tweak the file:

	oracle-dir\network\ADMIN\tnsnames.ora
	edit it, see below
	then REBOOT (not sure how else to tweak it)

Broken:
STACK =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = titan)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = stack)
    )
  )

Corrected:
STACK =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = titan)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = stack.titan)
    )
  )

The STACK seems to be your local name.
The stack.titan is the "service name" on the remote server name




Then:
	sqlplus user/pwd@localname

Importing a dump file:
(it's exp and imp, not export and import)
imp system/shad0w15@stack file=oracle-SearchTrack.dmp fromuser=kklop

LOTS of warnings

Exporting a dump file:
exp system/pwd@stack file=ender-SearchTrack-dec-02.dmp tables=(nie_log)

drivemanager.getconnection call
@bigmama => windows box in Kevin's network
change to IP address to Kevin's, does IP work?

Kevin, Oracle
	66.124.152.190 port 1521
	SID = "stack"
	login: mbennett / mbennett

Under Start menu / Oracle... / Dev tools / windows SQL Plus

For sql plus something like:
sqlplus mbennett/mbennett@66.124.152.190:1521:stack
^^^ no

test query
select count(*) from searchlog;

Kevin:
DriverManager.getConnection(
"jdbc:oracle:thin:@bigmomma:1521:stack",
Me:
"jdbc:oracle:thin:@66.124.152.190:1521:stack"



two other params
username: kklop / kklop

maybe mine would work as well

Oracle JDBC Driver and notesFrom: Kevin-Neil Klop [kklop@ideaeng.com]

Subject: Oracle JDBC Driver and notes
I put the driver into jdk/jre/lib/ext directory, which makes it automatically available to Java and I didn’t have to muck around with CLASSPATH stuff that way.

Notes for previous source code sent to you:

In the DriverManager call, there is a JDBC URL that looks like:

        Connection oracleConnection =
            DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:oracle:thin:@bigmomma:1521:stack",
                         "kklop",
                         "kklop");

You must change “bigmomma” to whatever DNS name you’ve assigned to my network.  The next two parameters (currently “kklop”) specify the user name and password (respectively) to use in the connection.

Pretty much everything else in the file is standard JDBC stuff.
