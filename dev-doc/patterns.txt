Patterns for several things

Where to put suggestions
	Config UI: Results List and Suggestions / Placement Patterns
		"Marker in HTML code:"
	config xml:
		file: config\search_engine.xml
		tag: <suggestion_marker_text>
		path: search_engine_info/suggestion_marker_text
		
		CDATA often helpful esp if pattern uses angle brackets

		"Number of documents found:"
	config xml:
