nie.sn.CSSClassNames

These are the ones used in SearchTrack Markups

	// Results list markup, wms = Web Master Suggests
	// USED BY OUR MARKUP
	public static final String WMS_SLOGAN_FONT = "nie_wms_slogan";
	public static final String ALT_SLOGAN_FONT = "nie_alt_term_slogan";
	public static final String ALT_TERM = "nie_alt_term";
	public static final String WMS_BOX1 = "nie_wms_outer_table";
	public static final String WMS_BOX2 = "nie_wms_inner_table";
	public static final String WMS_ICON = "nie_wms_icon";

The rest are used mostly by our own reporting UI, etc.


OR you can have use use YOUR own css class tags.

Can be done in the UI or by editing config files.

Configurator
In the newer versions there is a "Look and Feel" section where you can directly set CSS names.

OR
You can do this by editing the files in the defaults/ directory:

For example:

default_webmaster_suggests_header.xml

<default_webmaster_suggests_header
        text="The Webmaster suggests:"
        color="#000084"
        size="+1"
        markup_before="&lt;b&gt;"
        markup_after="&lt;/b&gt;"
        face="'MS Sans Serif',Geneva,sans-serif"
        class="your_box_class"
/>

(the spaces and indenting are just for readbility, it would actually be all jumbled on one line)

Notice the last line, the class="your_box_class"
