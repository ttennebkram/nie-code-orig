Generally a 3 way partnership:
	main config knows the various configured passwords
	request handler knows the CGI parameters that hold the password
	aux IO info tracks the assigned level
	state is maintained in the URL at this time
		via UILink which COPIES OVER CGI parameters
		which will pickup the pwd/session by default 
		unless you break it.  :-)
	TODO: obscure the CGI password
		SnRequestHandler = CGI view
			ADMIN_CGI_PWD_FIELD = password
			Add ADMIN_CGI_PWD_OBSCURED_FIELD = s
			getRequestAdminPwd()
			Add getRequestAdminKey()
		AuxIOInfo
			get / setAccessPassword
			Add get / setAccessKey
		nie.webui.xml_screens.generate_form.xslt
			in TWO PLACES!

	SearchTuningConfig
		was passwordToAccessLevel
		CHANGED to tokenToAccessLevel
		changed initPasswordTable
			will need additional changes for config obfiscation
		ADDED passwordToKeyOrNull
		hash of cPasswordLevelTable

	ReportCacherBase
		runReport, needs access

	nie.webui.xml_screens.Login.java
	Redirect after login???
		verify password...
	Configurator and Configurator2


	TODO: obscure the password stored in the XML config file
		initPasswordTable too

	ReportConstants.fMiscReportFields
		do NOT list password and/or session ID here
	UILink don't mention it, happens automatically
	Report link don't mention it, happens automatically
	Search engine link need to specifically snuff it out
