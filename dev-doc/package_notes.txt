Steps for creating a package:
* update the main README file
* create the JAR file of our files (see below)
* update supporting jars, IF NEEDED, usually it isn't
* copy the latest todo.txt file into system\dev-doc
	Maybe skim and update it it first, this is a COPY of it
* test that it runs!
* zip it up
* upload it
* let folks know it's there


To create the NIE jar file:

CD to main-project-dir\classes

And then

jar cvf ..\your-package-dir\system\jar_files\searchnames.jar nie

So we care jar'ing from classes\nie down.
And we're putting the results into the package\system\jar_files directory.
