We're setting up some demos for a few sites… if you could go so some searches on the test pages, that would be great. 

Hint: remember to use the 'back' key to search only from our form.. searching a second time 
from the native result list form will not work. 

Feel free to look at reports, but don't add any results just yet. If you *do* find a good suggestion page for one of your searches and that good result is not on the results you get, make a note and we'll use it when we define results.
