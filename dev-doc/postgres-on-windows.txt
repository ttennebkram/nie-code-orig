	left box
	lower right button Windows flag
	postgresql-8.3.5-1-windows.exe

Do the install
but hold off on running.

Then TWO MANUAL CHANGES

Manual change 1:

Get your HOST IP address and name with ipconfig /all
Edit
	C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\83\data\pg_hba.conf
	or
	D:\apps\PostgreSQL-83\data\pg_hba.conf
Add line:
	host    all         all         YOUR IP ADDR AND MASK	password
	Example:
	host    all         all         192.168.1.1/16          password

Notes:
* In earlier versions there was a different option for this
* "password" is not very secure, use other method for production systems


Manual change 2:

Control Panel
	Windows Firewall
		Exceptions tab
			Add Port...
			Name: PostgreSQL
			Port: 5432
			Type: TCP
OK, save, etc.


Run PostgreSQL Configurator
---------------------------

Start Menu
	PosgreSQL
		pgAdmin III

Add NON-localhost IP address
----------------------------
	get your HOST name with ipconfig /all
	This assumes previous step was run
	expand Servers
	right click "PostgreSQL 8.3"
	make sure it is NOT running
	right click -> properties
	Host field: CHANGE THIS to your NON localhost IP NAME or address
	IF IT'S GRAYED OUT, you didn't STOP the service!
		Cancel
		right click "PostgreSQL 8.3"
		Stop Service
		then right click -> Properties -> host, etc.
	Then right click
		Start Service
	right click again
		connect
	This should work
	I don't think you have to reboot or goto Control Panel / Services
		but I guess if nothing else works then try that.

Note: sometimes it puts red X's in the UI
	This is normal I guess, either they don't refresh the state or
		it means something... who knows.
	If you see a red x it MIGHT BE OK, try clicking on that object anyway

Create a new User FIRST (before DB)
-----------------------
	right click "PostgreSQL 8.3"
		make sure it's running
	expand "PostgreSQL 8.3"
	right click Login Roles
		New Login Role...
	Fill in just a couple fields:
		Role name (like customer name)
		password (twice)
		*** Can create database Objects set to YES / checked
	OK

Create a new database
---------------------
	As before, make sure PostgreSQL 8.3 is running and expanded
	Right click Databases
		New Database...
	Fill in just a few fields
		name: (maybe simple, same as customer and login)
		*** Owner: choose the user you just created
	OK

Test connection with SearchTrack
--------------------------------

Create a database.xml file.
Can do this with SearchTrack Configurator

Then test:
hello_db.bat database.xml

Try on local machine, same as PostgreSQL.

Then try on another machine, if needed.
If it works locally, but not remotely, see the Firewall settings
above for the machine that POSTGRES is installed on.
