NIE Original XPump and SearchTrack code
Written for Java 1.2, circa 2001

Of note:
* SearchTrack gave you info about your top query terms, and let you FIX IT on the spot.
* XPump was a spidering toolkit that could keep deep state, even across multiple pages.
* Hand-coded web server.
* Lots of XML utilities, featuring "include statements", AND the ability to change in memory but properly write back out to the separate files.

TODO: Needs TONS of conversion to turn into a modern Java app with a modern project structure.
Be kind when reading... some things weren't as obvious back then!
This would be a great project for showing how to convern from a pre-Generics world.
The idea here is to allow folks to learn from our early; this would also be a great "repackaging" project on many levels.

Although I wrote most of the code (Mark Bennett) I'd like to thank Kevin Klop, Miles Kehoe, Evan Sayer, Sean M. and Daya for their various contributions.
