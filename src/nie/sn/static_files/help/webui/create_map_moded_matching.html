Optional Sub-Site / Filter Constraints
</h3>

<p>
Many websites have check boxes or drop-down lists on their search
forms so that visitors can limit the scope of their searches.
For example, a visitor searching for &quot;<b>new products</b>&quot; could
limit their search to just the &quot;<b>Press Releases</b>&quot; section
of the site.
</p>

<p>
Normally, <b class="nie_product_name">SearchTrack</b>
suggestions are applied to the <b>entire site</b>,
no matter what section the visitor searches in.
However, you can <b>override this behavior</b> and have suggestions
<b>only</b> apply to sub-sections of your site.
</p>
<p>
If selected, the <b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Sub-Site / Filter Constraints</b>
<b>check boxes</b> will limit when suggestions are shown.
You can select multiple check boxes to match
more than one section; don't select any check boxes if you want
a suggestion to apply to your entire site.
