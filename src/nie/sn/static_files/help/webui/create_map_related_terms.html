<p>
If you notice that visitors frequently misspell a word, you can
provide the correct spelling.  Or there may be logically related items
you'd like to suggest.
</p>
<p>
This is done via the optional <b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Related Term(s)</b> box,
which lets you suggest
related search terms.  If set, these words will appear as hyperlinked terms near the
top of the results list.
</p>
<p>
You can also change the lead in text that appears in font of the links.
For example, if presenting a corrected spelling, you can change the
<b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Intro Text</b> to
&quot;<font color="#800000"><b>Did you mean:</b></font>&quot;.
