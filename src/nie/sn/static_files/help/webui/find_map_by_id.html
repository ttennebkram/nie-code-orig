Managing Directed Results Help:<br/>
Searching by the System Map ID
</h3>

<p>
This advanced option lets you locate a specific
<b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Directed Results Map</b>
that you would like to Edit or Delete.
</p>
<p>
The <b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Map ID</b> box lets you
search by entering a specific Map ID.
This is normally only used by Systems Administrators;
you should probably leave it blank.
