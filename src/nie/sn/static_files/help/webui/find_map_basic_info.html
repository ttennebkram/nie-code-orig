Managing Directed Results Help:<br/>
Searching by Term or URL
</h3>

<p>
This screen lets you locate
<b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Directed Results Maps</b>
that you would like to Edit or Delete.
</p>
<p>
The <b class="nie_vocabulary_term">Search Term</b> box lets you
search by term.
</p>
<p>
The <b class="nie_vocabulary_term">URL</b> box lets you
look for Maps that point to specific URLs.
</p>
<p>
You can use one or more asterisks (<b class="nie_vocabulary_term">*</b>) as
wildcard characters in either box.  This is particularly helpful when
searching for URLs.
For example you could search for *faq*
instead of http://mycompany.com/support/faq17.html.
</p>
<p>
You cannot search for a term and URL at the same time.
</p>
<p>
To see ALL of the Directed Results Maps, leave all
the boxes empty and click the Go button.
